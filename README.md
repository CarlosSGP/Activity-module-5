Based on the data, there are a few overall conclusions we can make based on the behavior, situation, and characteristics of the folks who received a coupon offer. 

First, after analyzing people who received a coupong for a bar, and people who received a coupon for a Coffee House, we notice that the higher the frequency that these folks visit one of these places then the higher
the tendency to accept the coupon. As depicted below:

Second, situations such as who the passenger is with, seem to also have an influence on coupon acceptance. For the Coffe House coupon,
People who were friends tend to accept the coupon more than those with kids, alone or with their partners.

For overall:

Finally, we also observe the influence of characteristics such as income on the acceptance rate of the coupons. For the whole sample,
we notice that the lower income bracket folks tend to accept the coupons more often than the middle to high income bracket people. One interesting exception occurs 
at the highest income bracket where the coupons acceptance rate evens out.
